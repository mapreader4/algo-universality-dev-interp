# Universality in Algorithmic Tasks: A Developmental Interpretability Perspective

My first idea for my project for the AI Safety Fundamentals March 2024 cohort. I subsequently realized that this might be beyond my current abilities for a project completable in a month, so I moved to working on a simpler version of the replication (add link when repository is uploaded). I may come back to this at some point.

## Project Goals

1. Replicate the original Toy Model of Universality paper
2. Examine phase transitions and feature development using the developmental interpretability library

## Credit

Thank you to Bilal Chughtai for your work on the original Toy Model of Universality codebase and paper.
